Here are some funny GitHub-related sentences — choose your favorite 😄

“I didn’t break the code… I just created unexpected features.”

“My GitHub commits are like my diet — inconsistent and full of regret.”

“I don’t need Google, I have StackOverflow… and GitHub… and panic.”

“I pushed code to GitHub. Now I wait for the bugs to push back.”

“GitHub is just social media for introverts who brag with code instead of selfies.”

“I didn’t commit a mistake… it was a feature branch.”

“Sometimes I commit changes just to feel productive.”

If you want, I can turn one of these into a funny GitHub bio or a caption for your profile.
